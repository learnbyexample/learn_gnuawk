# Testimonials

>Step up your cli fu with this fabulous intro & deep dive into awk. I learned a ton of tricks!
>
> — [feedback on twitter](https://twitter.com/killchain/status/1246820137455452163)

>I consider myself pretty experienced at shell-fu and capable of doing most things I set out to achieve in either bash scripts or fearless one-liners. However, my awk is rudimentary at best, I think mostly because it's such an unforgiving environment to experiment in.
>
>These books you've written are great for a bit of first principles insight and then quickly building up to functional usage. I will have no hesitation in referring colleagues to them!
